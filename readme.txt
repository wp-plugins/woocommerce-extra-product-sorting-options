Rename default product sorting and add alphabetical, reverse alphabetical, on sale, and random sorting

== Description ==

WooCommerce Extra Product Sorting Options provides options that extend the default WooCommerce orderby options on the shop page. You can optionally set a new name for the default sorting (helpful if you've used this to create a custom sorting order), and can enable alphabetical, reverse alphabetical, on sale, and random product sorting options.

**Requires: WooCommerce 2.1+**

= Features =
Includes options to:

 - rename default product sorting (i.e., change to "Our Sorting")
 - enable alphabetical product sorting
 - enable reverse alphabetical sorting
 - enable on sale sorting (thanks to [Bryce Adams](http://bryceadams.com/order-products-sale-woocommerce/) for the idea)
 - enable randomized product sorting

= Rename Default Sorting =
You can customize your product sorting order on your shop pages - [here's a handy tutorial](http://www.sellwithwp.com/create-woocommerce-custom-product-sorting/) to do so. However, many shop admins like to then rename this from "Default Sorting" to something more descriptive, such as "Our Sorting" or "Our Selection". You can optionally enter a new name for this sorting order if desired.

= Adding Sorting Options =
When you create a customized sorting order, you lose the ability to sort products alphabetically. This plugin gives you the ability to add new sorting options to list products by title A to Z or in reverse order (Z to A).

You can add the option to sort items by sale status - there's a sorting option to show "On Sale" items first in the shop catalog.

Finally, you can add a "randomized" sorting option just for fun - any time this sorting is selected, the product order will be randomized when the shop page is viewed.

== Installation ==

1. Be sure you're running WooCommerce 2.1+ in your shop.
2. Upload the entire `woocommerce-extra-product-sorting-options` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload the .zip file with the plugin under **Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload**
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
4. Go to **WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products**. The new settings are added after "Default Product Sorting". If you enable more sorting options, you can set these as new defaults as well.
5. View [documentation on the product page](http://www.skyverge.com/product/woocommerce-extra-product-sorting-options/) for more help if needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need to rename the default sorting? =
Nope. You can use this plugin to simply add alphabetical, reverse alphabetical, and randomized sorting to your shop pages. Any of the settings are entirely optional.

= How do I set my new sorting option as the default? =
When you check to enable these options, save your Product settings. You'll now be able to select your new options as a default under the "Default Product Sorting" list.

= Can I change the sorting label in the shop dropdown? =
Yep! You can use the [Say What plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/) to change the text - for example, you could change the label that says "Sort by name: A to Z" to "Sort alphabetically". See the screenshots for an example. 

The text domain to use is `woocommerce`.
